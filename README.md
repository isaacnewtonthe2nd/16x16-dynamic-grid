# 16x16-dynamic-grid

This project is to showcase my skills and understanding of the DOM and how to manipulate html and css from javascript. In the project, I created a dynamic grid page that prompts the user to input a number and then use that number to generate a grid. For example, if a user inputs 64, the program creates a 64 x 64 grid. This grid is also made to be dynamic in a sense that when you go over the squares on the grids, it generates random colors and increase the opacity each times up to 10 interactions. You can take a look at the program to get a better sense. The main idea behind this project is to use as minimal as possible of html and css, and use javascript to generate everything. As you can see in my codes, there is barely any html and css, mostly javascript. So I can say, this excercise is a complete success.
